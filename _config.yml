  Welcome! My name is Aaron Meek, and I am a fiscal analyst with the Michigan House Fiscal Agency. 
  I work directly with the Committee on Appropriations on budget issues related to the judiciary and 
  state police, in addition to providing legislative analysis and support to the Committee on Judiciary. 
  Prior to joining the Agency, I received my master's degree in political science from The George 
  Washington University in Washington, DC, the same institution where I served as a graduate fellow 
  studying American judicial politics and administrative law, as well as a teaching assistant for 
  courses on the American government and political research methodology.
