Welcome! My name is Aaron Meek, and I am a political science Ph.D. student at The George Washington University in Washington, DC. My research centers on American judicial politics, and some of my current projects include work on administrative agency compliance with federal court of appeals decisions, the impact of state supreme court selection on legal opinion clarity, and the influence of congressional court curbing on the behavior of U.S. Supreme Court justices. I am also interested in bureaucratic policymaking and the politics of administrative law.

 I am originally from Rochester Hills, MI, and received my B.A. in political science from Michigan State University and my M.A. in political science from The George Washington University. Outside of academic work, I enjoy spending my time at the piano, watching Spartan football, and hanging out with my nieces and nephews.
