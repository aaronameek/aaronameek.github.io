Welcome! My name is Aaron Meek, and I currently serve as a fiscal analyst for the Michigan House Fiscal Agency. In this capacity, I support the House Committee on Appropriations by providing fiscal analysis on topics related to the budgets of the Michigan State Police and Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, in addition to providing legislative analysis for bills before the House Committee on Judiciary.

Prior to joining the HFA, I received my master's degree in political science after working for several years as a graduate researcher and teaching assistant at The George Washington University in Washington D.C., where my research centered on American courts and administrative agencies. While at GW, I also helped instruct several introductory courses on American politics, political methodology, and the U.S. Congress and legislative process. I also hold a bachelor's degree in political science from Michigan State University, where I served as an instructional assistant for courses on judicial politics and general social science research methods.

I am originally from Rochester Hills and currently reside in Lake Orion. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time at the piano, experimenting with computer programming, watching Spartan football, and hanging out with my nieces and nephews.

I am also interested in bureaucratic policymaking and the politics of administrative law.
